### ABOUT
The Body Mass Index is a measure of body fat using the weight and height of the Adult. It’s a good way to gauge whether your weight is in healthy proportion to your height. In fact, knowing your BMI can help you determine any health risks you may face if it’s outside of the healthy range.

# Being overweight can lead to a range of chronic conditions including:
    Type 2 Diabetes
    High blood pressure
    Heart or blood vessel problems
    Cardiovascular disease
    Musculoskeletal problems

# Being underweight can result in other health issues like:
    Risk of malnutrition
    Osteoporosis
    Anaemia
